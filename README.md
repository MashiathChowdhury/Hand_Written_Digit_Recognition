# Hand_Written_Digit_Recognition
This project uses a Convolutional Neural Network trained on the MNIST dataset to recognize handwritten digits (0-9). It includes preprocessing to handle real images and a Streamlit app for easy digit prediction from uploaded images. A simple, effective example for learning deep learning and computer vision basics
